# 🩺 Apex Health AI

An AI-powered **Personalized Medicine Recommendation System** built with **Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit**.  
It predicts possible conditions from symptoms and provides **medications, precautions, workouts, and descriptions** — all in an interactive, cinematic UI. 🚀

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

To get **Apex Health AI** up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/apex-health-ai.git
cd apex-health-ai
````

*(Replace `yourusername/apex-health-ai.git` with your actual GitHub repository URL)*

---

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file. See "Generating requirements.txt" below.)*

---

### 4. Data Files

This application relies on several CSV files. You **MUST** place these files in the **root directory** of your project (the same directory as `app.py`):

* `symtoms_df.csv`
* `description.csv`
* `precautions_df.csv`
* `workout_df.csv`
* `medications.csv`
* `medicine.csv`

⚠️ *If these files are missing, the application will not run.*

---

### 5. Run the Streamlit Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the **Apex Health AI** app in your browser (usually at 👉 [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)).

## 📦 Generating `requirements.txt`

To ensure others can easily install all necessary libraries, create a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Ensure it contains at least:

```
pandas
numpy
streamlit
scikit-learn
```
